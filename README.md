# Trackers data collector (Strava+Endomondo)

In 2020 Endomondo was shut down forever. All data was downloaded, but not Strava, nor other sport trackes can accept its data properly.

Goal of this project is to download data from different trackers and collect it in one DB. Visual outcome is "nice to have".
